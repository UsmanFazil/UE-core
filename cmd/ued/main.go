Key Features:
- Advanced PoS consensus with 28,846 UE minimum stake requirement
- BFT finalization with 67% threshold for block immutability
- High-performance smart contract execution environment
- Modular architecture for scalability and upgrades
- Enhanced security with custom slashing mechanisms`,
